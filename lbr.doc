lbr v5.1.1
==========

  lbr is a shell script which, used in conjunction with lar, allows the
Midnight Commander (mc) to browse inside LBR files in the same way that
it can browse TAR files.

Setting up
==========
   (Depending upon your particular environment, ${installdir} may be 
   /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib or, with more recent Linux distributions,
   /usr/share/mc.)

  See ${installdir}/mc/extfs/README for more details. The steps you will 
need to take are:

1. Install lbr in the directory ${installdir}/lib/mc/extfs
2. Edit extfs.ini, and add the line

lbr

3. Run mc, and select Command | Extension file edit
4. Add the following lines just above the "Default target" line:

#lbr
regex/\.(lbr|LBR)$
	Open=%cd %d/%p#lbr/
	View=%view{ascii} lar tv '%f'
        Extract=lar e '%f'

To test if it worked, start mc and highlight an LBR file. Press RETURN and
you should be able to browse its contents.
