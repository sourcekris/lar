  LAR - Library Archiver v5.1.2

  Instructions for normal use of lar are in lar.doc.

  Instructions for use of lar as a Midnight Commander extension are in 
lbr.doc.

New in version 5.1.2:
=====================

* Patches from Steven Hirsch to fix compilation under SuSE 9.2.
 
New in version 5.1.1:
=====================

* Reorganising a library preserves time stamps, exact file sizes and CRCs.
* In the verbose listing, years are displayed using all 4 digits.
* When a library is reorganised or a new library is created, the number of
 slots requested will be allocated (previously, if the number was a multiple
 of 4, one fewer slot than requested would be allocated).
* All files are opened in binary mode. 

  Thanks to C.B.Falconer for suggesting these modifications, and yes, I know
it was more than a year ago.
