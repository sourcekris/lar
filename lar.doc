NAME
       lar - library archiver

SYNOPSIS
       lar function library [files]...


DESCRIPTION
       lar is a Unix program to manipulate CP/M LU format libraries. The orig-
       inal CP/M library program LU is the product of Gary P. Novosielski. The
       primary	 use   of  lar	is  to	combine	 several  files	 together  for
       upload/download to a personal computer.


FUNCTION LETTERS
       One of the following letters must be used:


       u      - Update, add files to library

       t      - Table of contents

       e      - Extract files from library

       p      - Print files in library to stdout

       d      - Delete files in library

       r      - Reorganise library (remove gaps caused by file deletion)


       Other keys:

       v      - Verbose

       l      - Directory listing will be in the  format  used	by  mc(1)  for
	      extended filesystems.


LEGAL
       This  program  is  public  domain  software,  no	 warranty  intended or
       implied.


HISTORY
       This version of lar has been rewritten to match version 5  of  the  LBR
       format definition, and supports date stamps, CRCs and exact file sizes.


BUGS/MISFEATURES
       The biggest problem is text files, the programs tries  to  detect  text
       files  vs.  binaries by checking for non-Ascii (8th bit set) chars.  If
       the file is text then it will throw away	 Control-Z  chars  which  CP/M
       puts on the end.	 All files in library are padded with Control-Z at the
       end to the CP/M sector size if necessary.

       No effort is made to handle the difference between CP/M and Unix end of
       line  chars.   CP/M  uses Cr/Lf and Unix just uses Lf.  The solution is
       just to use the Unix command sed when necessary.
